# Projects

This folder contains your game projects created with `scripts/create_project.sh`.

Each project is self-contained with:
- **game/** - Your game code and assets
- **build/** - Compiled executable
- **scripts/** - Build and run scripts
- All necessary ReiLua source files

## Create a New Project

```bash
cd /path/to/ReiLua-Enhanced
./scripts/create_project.sh
```

The script will guide you through setting up:
- Project name
- Executable name
- Author information
- Version and metadata

Your projects are automatically gitignored in the main repository.
